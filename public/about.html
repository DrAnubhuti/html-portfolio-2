<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi! My name is [Anubhuti Singh], and I’m a student at [N-A].

I was born and raised in [PATNA] and have always been interested in learning new things. When I was younger, I would read all day—and it wasn’t just for fun! It was because I wanted to express myself in the form of words on my journals .

I’ve always loved fixing Everthing, but my favorite thing to FIX is "human beings". I think they’re so interesting! They have lives and personalities, and they can be funny, sad, or happy. They can also be adorable! And the best part is that they’re all so different.

I’ve been working on a portfolio since high school but never finished it until recently. Now that I’m done with classes for this semester, I hope you’ll take a look at it!></p>







<p>I’m a recent graduate of [Patna Women's College] with a B.Sc in [Chemistry]. I’m looking for an opportunity to gain experience in [IT], preferably one that involves a lot of Coding Skills and project management.

My skills include:

– [Web Developer]

– [Advanced CSS]
    
- [API's]
    
- [Java Script]
My professors have told me that I am very organized and detail-oriented, which is why I think this job would be a good fit.
</p>

<p>I’ve been lucky to have worked with some fantastic people at [ My office ], and I would love to show you what I can do.

I’m a jack-of-all-trades person—I know how to do everything from data analysis to content creation, but my favorite thing is writing. I love being able to take something that needs to be shared and make it come alive in a way that makes people want to read it.

    And now that we’re going through this transition in our company, I think it’s imperative to share my knowledge and experience with the world—to help other businesses grow, tell their stories, and connect with their customers.</p>
